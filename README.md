## An update of [CyberRewind](https://github.com/CyberRewind)'s [Question Game](https://github.com/CyberRewind/Questions-Game-)

This version fetches questions from a "questions.json" file, rather than fetching them from the internet.

The list of questions can be modified quickly and easily by editing the questions in [questions.txt](https://github.com/kay-who-codes/Dionnes-Question-Game/blob/main/Non-App/questions.txt) to your liking, then running [Questions JSON Generator.py](https://github.com/kay-who-codes/Dionnes-Question-Game/blob/main/Non-App/Questions%20JSON%20Generator.py) to generate a new, updated and formatted [questions.json](https://github.com/kay-who-codes/Dionnes-Question-Game/blob/main/questions.json) file which works with the app.
